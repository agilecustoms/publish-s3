# publish-s3

GitHub Action to upload objects to Amazon S3.
Intended to be used only as part of GH action [agilecustoms/publish](https://github.com/agilecustoms/publish)

Main features:
- Set content type (MIME type) to serve files from the "website" bucket
- In normal mode adds tag `Release=true`, in dev-mode adds tag: `Release=false`. This allows automatic removals.
Read more about [release types](https://github.com/agilecustoms/publish/blob/main/docs/release-types.md)
- Ability to upload in several dirs to support semantic versioning: `/myservice/1.2.4`, `/myservice/1.2`, `/myservice/1`, `/myservice/latest`
- To avoid clutter, the directories are first cleaned up, and then files uploaded
